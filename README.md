# bandcampcards

Printable Trading Cards for BandCamp releases. Includes QR code, artwork, and info.

Not in any way affiliated with Bandcamp. Probably don't sell anything you make with this.

I'd love it if there were official printouts like this you could order from bandcamp.

The idea is that digital music is higher in quality than analog storage mediums. Not to mention more environmentally friendly, longer lasting, and convenient. There's just one problem... it's very anti-social. I remember having a collection of music in the form of CD albums (and a few cassettes) that my friends could browse when they came over. You could read the album inserts and tracklist together very easily, without having to menu dive through tiny screens.
